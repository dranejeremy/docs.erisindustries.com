The eris stack has undergone many changes in the past six months. When I joined eris in July, the old stack was just about deprecated, docker had recently been embraced full tilt, and our blockchain orchestration tool was a couple months away from the 0.10.0 release. While making incremental contributions to eris-cli and fighting [docker](https://docker.com), I was also learning to stitch together our various tools natively. The process, albeit daunting (compared, say, to building a simple web app), is fairly straightforward once layed out clearly. Embracing docker does simplify things and although the learning curve is far from steep, it's well worth it. This post is intended to first provide a high level overview of all our tools followed by a detailed explanation how they work together. Modularity is a strong focus (simplified, again, by docker). The complicated task of orchestrating all the various requirements for a smart-contract-focused blockchain is exactly why we went all-in on docker, despite various ongoing pain points. We like to think of [eris:cli](https://erisindustries.com/components/eriscli/) as "docker for blockchains". For more on thinking about eris <-> docker, see Casey's post [here](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/09/05/docker-and-eris/).

Let's get started! Figure 1 shows the relationship between all the tools in the eris stack. Before docker, each had to be installed individually (`git clone` followed by `go install` a handful of times...yuk). Docker also provides the ability to seamlessly link the containers, so that the individual processes can talk to each other. With or without docker, there are several considerations for thinking about the mechanics of your chain as an application. The first three suffice if your goal is writing and testing smart contracts. The rest are for building a useable application at scale.

WTF are docker containers and how do processes run inside them? What does this design mean for you, the user of `eris`?

##Blockchain Application Checklist

1. It all starts with your keys. 
This is crypto, remember? Key management is an inherently complex process and is something that should be given serious thought. It's getting easier overall (e.g. [keybase](https://keybase.io/)), but at the moment there's still quite a bit of complexity involved. A key needs to be generated and secured *for each participant* in your blockchain. There's not much one can do on a blockchain without a validator or participant who can't sign transactions. This is a fundamentally different approach for web services compared to login/password. If you're gonna be blockchaining, do try to really understand how keys work and are used. Our key signing daemon [eris:keys](https://docs.erisindustries.com/documentation/ekeys/) provides the basic functionality for getting started with development. As with all the tools in our stack, this key daemon can be swapped out for any other compatible cryptographic key tool. In fact, we anticipate moving to PGP in the future. 

2. Roll a chain.
Blockchains have a few key properties: validators (specified in the all important genesis file or updated on the fly), a consensus engine (the mechanism for updating state), and a virtual machine (for the smarmot contracts). Our current design is opinated and uses [Tendermint](http://tendermint.com/) as the consensus engine and a fork of the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](which link?). Both the consensus engine and virtual machine are, again, modules that can be swapped in and out as need by. Currently, they are packaged together as [eris:db](https://erisindustries.com/components/erisdb/). The *docker image* used to run eris:db also contains [mint-client](https://github.com/eris-ltd/mint-client), a suite of low-level clients for talking to tendermint chains. At a higher level, we have [eris-db.js](https://docs.erisindustries.com/documentation/eris-db-js/) for talking to and eris:db server. An [eth-client](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eth-client) is also available if you'd rather be rolling an ethereum chain.

3. Deploy contracts.
Write solidity contracts. Compile 'em. Send 'em to the chain. We provide [hosted compilers (the lllc-server)](https://docs.erisindustries.com/documentation/eris-compilers/), and as you would expect, swapping in your own compiler is as easy as flag with [eris:pm](https://erisindustries.com/components/epm/), our contract deployement tool which simplifies a handful of steps (horizontal curly bracket in figure). The [eris-abi](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-abi) is used for formatting calls to previously deployed contracts. More on that below.

4. Write you app (Dapp). We call them services. A handful are already [built for you](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-services). Some of them are used internally, for example, [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), to provide a data lake for applications ( `eris files`). The [mindy](https://github.com/eris-ltd/mindy) [testnet](pinkpenguin.interblock.io:46657) has been running for many months now and works fairly well for sub-domain name registry. The [toadserver](https://github.com/eris-ltd/toadserver) integrates each mindy, IPFS, and the name registry feature of eris:db, to serve as a download server; soon to be replacing github as part of the `eris init` sequence. Services glue together other services, and can often be added to you application with just a few lines of code. Stay tuned for an detailed tutorial on making a service. 

5. Deploy to the cloud.
This process will use [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) and, eventually, [docker-swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/). The command `eris remotes` is currently a work in progress and not yet available. It will greatly simplify the process in [this chain deploying tutorial](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/chaindeploying/). 

6. Voila! Your app is ready for users. Of course, you'll want to build a user interface, likely at the javascript layer. The above `remotes` command will bundle deployment of your chain, service, and any required dependencies.

Above, we've highlighted the relevant repositories/components currently maintained as part of the Eris stack. Below, we'll go through how to implement each piece, and in the process integrate all available tutorials. So where should you even start? This is *one* approach - the one I consider most intuitive for thinking about the design of you chain/application. This is how I do it when testing or implementing the toadserver. See Ethan's [tutorial w/ native tooling](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/eris_by_curl/) for another pipeline. 

##The development lifecycle

We start with the genesis file. The sets up your chain and contains approved validators, their *initial coin distribution*, any permissions, roles, or names can be assigned to them. Maybe you want 5, maybe you want 100. See [this tutorial](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/chainmaking-advanced/) for more info on generating a genesis file (the `mintgen` command) and chainmaking. Of course, since you'll need the public keys of everyone you'd like included, a key pair will need to be generated for each participant/validator. Note that the chain making tutorial starts with [making keys](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/keyexporting/). Either you do this all yourself and distribute the keys or ask each user to generate a pair themselves and provide the pubkey. You could also try the [Blocklab tool](http://blocklab.levvel.io/). Each have pros and cons that need to be carefully thought through. At any rate, it is always possible to update the validator set with a bond/unbond transaction, or, if they misbehave, their security deposit (bond) can be slashed: validator they are no longer. 

It's time to start bringing nodes online. The master node starts up and peers can join like so: a seed of the master node's IP:port is added to their configuration file used in the `eris chains new` sequence. So long as the peer coming online has a key that 1) can sign (via the key daemon) and 2) is included in the genesis file, then it'll join the network. Once >2/3 of known validators join, the chain will begin validating transactions (i.e., updating state, "mining", producing blocks etc). If the chain drops below 2/3 validators, it will halt. (something about PoS ?/ fork-choice?). The status and health of a chain can be monitored easily through various means such as the `mintinfo` command from mint-client, the js library (port 1337), or pure http endpoints (port 46657). The `chains` command for eris-cli is designed to handle all operations for one or more chains. With your chain running, you can send transactions (`mintx send`) and deploy contracts (`epm` / `eris contracts`). At the tool level, these would primarily be used by chain admins whereas developers for a user-facing application would likely be working at the javascript layer for sending transactions and [deploying contracts](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-contract.js). 

Now you need an application. Before we get into some design considerations for an app, let's dissect the process of sending transactions and deploying contracts. At the end of the day, the latter is the former but includes compiled byte code as part of the transaction (from the lllc-server). The `mintx` command will first craft a transaction and, if specified, sign and broadcast it to the designated chain. Again, since the key signing that transaction must be available to the daemon, docker simplifies this logitics challenge, especially for updates. So that's pretty easy but it's no bitcoin wallet in terms of simplicity.  

Now let's deploy a contract. For writing smart contracts, see Andreas' [epic five part solidity tutorial](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/solidity/). Ok, you've got a simple contract and would like to deploy it. The first step takes the solidity code and compiles it (no different than C/go ... ?) into bytecode. This bytecode will be used as the raw input for `mintx` of the contract you're deploying. Now your contract is on the chain and can be called with `mintx call` or (js function..?). This process of: solidity -> lllc-server -> mintx -> sign -> deployed is greatly simplified by eris:pm; see the [contract deploying tutorial](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/contractsdeploying/). In essence, you write a contract, specify a few parameters in a .yaml file then vrooom `eris contracts deploy`.

Once a contract is on the chain, it can be called. For this step, the abi formats the call into code that can be read by the smart contract....[zr] need to learn how to call a contract.  

So a transaction hits the chain, then what? For details of the tendermint consensus, see [here](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Byzantine-Consensus-Algorithm). Roughly, the transaction will be proposed and the validators will vote on whether or not to accept it in the next block. Voting happens in a round robin manner (...more details?). In an ongoing refactor of [eris:db](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db) and [tendermint core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint), the consensus engine will be its own module which talks to the eris:db application layer over [tmsp](http://tendermint.com/posts/tendermint-socket-protocol/), This will make experimentation with other consensus engines much simpler moving forward. Indeed, it is already possible to roll an eth chain and play on it with the [eth-client](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eth-client/blob/master/README.md). So we've got three ways to deploy contracts and send transactions (note the latter can also be conveniently accomplished via eris:pm), 1) from scratch using the low(est)-level tool (`mintx`), 2) with eris:pm and, 3) the js libraries. The way in which certain contracts are deployed and by whom at these different levels should be considered for you application.

Time to build your service (app). But wait. What is eris-cli anyways, and why would you want to use it? How will help it operate your blockchain application? As previously mentioned, it's an orchestration tool. Everything we've discussed so far *can* be done natively (i.e., without docker); this requires stitching together the various tools (see, again, [eris by curl](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/eris_by_curl/)). `eris` makes it easy(er) to co-ordinate all the things you need to roll a smart-contract ready chain with an application. Yay Docker! With that in mind, our goal is to build and define a service that, when started, links up to the existing chain *and any other services that are required* for the application to run smoothly. Once your service is built (write a bunch of code, basically), all it needs is a [service definition file](https://docs.erisindustries.com/documentation/eris-cli/0.11.0/services_specification/) which simplifies the `docker run` process. This of course assumes you've written a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and [built an image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockerimages/). 

The last tricky part, now that we have a defined service, is to deploy it to the cloud with >1 node/validator. Here again, docker shines, this time as a machine. The `eris` tool has a global flag `--machine` which can be used to specify another docker daemon (on any number of other hosts) upon which to execute a command. Note: these docker machine will have been pre-created (`docker-machine create`). The beauty of this feature is that the files needed for these deployments need only be on the host, and, of course, you only need to install `eris` once. As already mentioned, the upcoming command `remotes` will greatly simplify this deployment process. 

There you have it. From A to Blockchains, this is how you get rolling with the marmots. Want a tutorial that we haven't provided? Let us know(link to our to-be-open-sourced-doc-repo where people can open issues when docs/tuts are broken and also do PRs)
